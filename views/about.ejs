                <h3>Source Data</h3>
                <p>
                    All data is souced from the <a href="http://www.hydro.com.au/water/energy-data">Hydro Tasmania website</a>.
                    It is updated every week on Monday.
                </p>
                <h3>The Main Chart</h3>
                <!-- TODO: Image of chart -->
                <p>
                    The chart illustrates the following characteristic of each lake in the Hydro Tasmania system. Clicking on a lake will show the historical levels chart for that lake.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Relative Size</h4>
                            <p>
                                The size of the box for each lake indicates its relative size. The larger the box, the larger the lake.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Current Lake Level</h4>
                            <p>
                                The current level of the lake is indicated by two methods:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                      A percentage value of maximum capacity.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        A blue fill which visually indicates the percentage value of
                                        maximum capacity. The higher the fill, the higer the level.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Remaining Energy</h4>
                            <p>
                                The amount of energy stored in the lake measured in Gigawatt hours (GWh).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Historical Levels Chart</h3>
                <p>
                    This chart illustrates the lake level over time as a percentage of maximum capcity.
